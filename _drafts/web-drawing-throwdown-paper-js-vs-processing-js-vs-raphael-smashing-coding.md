  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Paper.js, Processing.js and Rapha&euml;l are the leading libraries for drawing on the Web right now. A couple of others are up and coming, and you can always use Flash, but these three work well with HTML5 and have the widest support among browser vendors.<&#47;p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Choosing the right framework will determine the success of your project. This article covers the advantages and disadvantages of each, and the information you need to make the best choice.<&#47;p>

<p>I am interested in looking at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;processingjs.org&#47;" target="_blank">processingjs <&#47;a>for a html5 game. I think it'll offer a great interface for creating that "game loop" feel. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;paperjs.org&#47;" target="_blank">PaperJs <&#47;a>seems the most intuitive for the average JavaScript user. And then there is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;raphaeljs.com&#47;" target="_blank">Raphael <&#47;a>which probably has the best support for older browsers (simply by using SVG as opposed to Canvas), but is not really good at animation.</p>
