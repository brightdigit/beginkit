  I was recently asked what someone should learn if he or she wanted to get into modern web development. Flash&nbsp;would have been great a few years ago. However the industry has moved away from plugin-based development. Instead it has moved towards HTML5 and&nbsp;JavaScript&nbsp;mostly because of the mobile market.

  So if you are interested , here are some resources for modern web development (HTML5, javascript):

    HTML5 version of twentyten them for wordpress users , with fall back for browsers

<h1>Coders and Designers<&#47;h1><br />
For one thing you can look at the answer on&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Stackoverflow <&#47;a>(a great site for coding questions). It has some <a href="http:&#47;&#47;stackoverflow.com&#47;questions&#47;4744906&#47;would-you-recommend-starting-from-html5-css3-for-beginners" target="_blank">good insight <&#47;a>into this. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.alistapart.com&#47;" target="_blank">A List Apart<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.smashingmagazine.com&#47;" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine<&#47;a> are great web development resources for designers. In addition to those sites, <a title="quirksmode" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.quirksmode.org&#47;" target="_blank">Quirksmode<&#47;a>&nbsp;has some great stuff on browser compatibility especially concerning mobile browsers.</p>
<h1>The Good Stuff<&#47;h1><br />
JavaScript was written for beginners (supposedly). Unfortunately&nbsp;that can make it very easy to write bad&nbsp;code. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.crockford.com&#47;" target="_blank">Douglous Crockford<&#47;a> does a good job differentiating the good&nbsp;parts from the bad parts. He actually has a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;oreilly.com&#47;catalog&#47;9780596517748" target="_blank">book <&#47;a>called "Javascript:&nbsp;The Good Parts". His blog&nbsp;posts and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;yuiblog.com&#47;crockford&#47;" target="_blank">yahoo videos<&#47;a> are really good. He talks about its history,&nbsp;how it compares with other programming languages and the nuances of how it is implemented differently in web browsers. It's a good primer for anyone interested in&nbsp;JavaScript.</p>
<h1>jQuery<&#47;h1><br />
Besides the ability to write bad code, there are those pesky browser&nbsp;compatibility issues. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;jquery.com&#47;" target="_blank">jQuery <&#47;a>&nbsp;does a good job fixing both. It&nbsp;is a javascript library that abstracts most of the&nbsp;weirdness with browsers and the language itself. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ejohn.org&#47;" target="_blank">John Resig<&#47;a> is the&nbsp;creator and has great blog posts on&nbsp;JavaScript&nbsp;and the jQuery in general.</p>
<h1>Canvas<&#47;h1><br />
If you want to do some intense graphics stuff take a look the Canvas&nbsp;element in html5. This along with javascript are <em>the<&#47;em> flash killers&nbsp;because you can pretty much do much of the graphics programming you may want to do (+&nbsp;the <video> tag, see youtube). Resig has a neat project called&nbsp;<a title="processingjs" href="http:&#47;&#47;processingjs.org&#47;" target="_blank">processingjs <&#47;a>you may want to play around with.</p>
<h1>Final Thoughts<&#47;h1><br />
Learn by example when you have the chance. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;apple.com" target="_blank">Apple <&#47;a>does some interesting stuff. Use the developer tools which come with most of the browsers or simply "view source". Remember <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dontfeartheinternet.com&#47;the-basics&#47;dont-fear-the-browser" target="_blank">don't fear the browser<&#47;a>.</p>
