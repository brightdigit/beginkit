Thank you for subscribing to tagmento news! 

For our first newsletter, we are sending out a **[brief survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Y9grfU5VheqcB0KOIAqRPTbabUi7U0qsuAVvGLUhsug/viewform)** to give you the opportunity to tell us your story:

* How did you find out about tagmento?
* How do you track time now?
* What are your biggest challenges?
* What do you use that time tracking info for?

It also lets us know if you are interested in **getting early access to the app**. 

So if you do want early access to tagmento, please take a few minutes and fill out **[this brief survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Y9grfU5VheqcB0KOIAqRPTbabUi7U0qsuAVvGLUhsug/viewform)**.
