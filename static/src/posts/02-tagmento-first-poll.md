Part of the early design process of any app is understanding your audience. To help us do that, we have a **[survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Y9grfU5VheqcB0KOIAqRPTbabUi7U0qsuAVvGLUhsug/viewform)** to give us some information about how folks like you **track time and try to use their time more efficiently**. This will also help find people who may be interested in **getting early access to betas of tagmento**.

Please do fill out the **[form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Y9grfU5VheqcB0KOIAqRPTbabUi7U0qsuAVvGLUhsug/viewform)** by **May 8th 2016 11:59pm**. Those who fill out the survey will be considered as early beta tester for tagmento. **Thank you for helping make this product great!**
