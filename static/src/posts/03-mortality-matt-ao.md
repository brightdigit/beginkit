How often are we willing to look at how much time we have lef
Time flies like an arrow;
Fruit flies like a banana

Mortality is a new tab extension that reminds you of your precise age.
A bitter-sweet motivational tool; it illustrates how little time we have.
Circles represent months, for the average lifespan of 80 years.
As you age, the circles fill, and are split into the main Chapters of your life.
These are the default chapters:
  -Early Years (0 to ~5 years, Elementary starts in September))
  -Elementary (7 years)
  -Middle (2 years)
  -High School (4 years)
  -College (4 years)
  -Work (~44 years, Retire at 65)
  -Retire (~15 years, Death at 80)

Get busy living, or get busy dying.
You can never go back :)
