**Since May 19 2013, David El Achkar was logged every minute of his life.** Whenever he completes a task, he logs that activity in his Google Calendar. He calls this project **[LifeLog](http://david.achkar.com/life-log/)**.

In December of 2013, he gave a **[talk](http://david.achkar.com/qssv-lifelog-talk/)** detailing the experience of tracking his time as well as what insights he gained from it. Some of the insights he's gained include:

* Just **over half his time is spent on basic survival activities** (e.g., Sleep, Food, shower)
* he approximatley **spends 30% of his time working**

You should definitely checkout **[his talk](http://david.achkar.com/life-log/)** and **[his blog](http://david.achkar.com)** for more details on how someone else tracks and analyzes their time.
