  content: It depends what type of expncieere you're looking for.New Super Mario Bros.
    Wii caters to having up to four people playing around trying to go through 77
    levels in 2D. Having friends or family playing with you makes this game a blast.
    It's around ten hours to get through, pending you play every level. If you go
    solo, it's still a good game, but it's the multiplayer that makes this one shine.Super
    Mario Galaxy 2 takes what made the first Galaxy great and adds to it. It has 2D
    and 3D levels and offers both challenges that require skill and speed. You will
    constantly be asked to do new things throughout the majority of the adventure
    such as speed running a level, avoiding a ton of enemies that are following the
    same path, or what have you.Basically, NSMB Wii is the best 2D platformer this
    generation, and Galaxy 2 is the best 3D platformer of this generation. Take your
    pick. You're probably going to like both.

Love Super Mario Bros? Take a look at this <a href="http:&#47;&#47;johanpeitz.com&#47;asms&#47;" target="_blank">flash game<&#47;a> by <a title="Johan Pietz" href="http:&#47;&#47;johanpeitz.com&#47;" target="_blank">Johan Peitz<&#47;a>. He takes Super Mario Bros. and turns it into a single screen game (think Donkey Kong). It's good for some quick fun.</p>
